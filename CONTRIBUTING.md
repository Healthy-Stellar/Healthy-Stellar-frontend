## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed and configured:

| Requirement                     | Version / Notes                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node.js**                     | v18 or later (LTS recommended)                                                                                  |
| **npm**                         | v9 or later (bundled with Node.js)                                                                              |
| **Git**                         | Any recent version                                                                                              |
| **Freighter browser extension** | Install from [freighter.app](https://www.freighter.app/) — required to sign Stellar transactions in the browser |

### Stellar Testnet Account

You need a funded testnet account to interact with the app locally:

1. Open Freighter and switch the network to **Testnet**.
2. Copy your public key.
3. Visit the [Stellar Testnet Faucet (Friendbot)](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test) and fund your account with test XLM.
4. Your account is now ready for local development — no real funds are involved.

---

## Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Healthy-Stellar-frontend.git
cd Healthy-Stellar-frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Open .env.local and fill in the required values (see .env.example for guidance)

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Note:** Make sure your Freighter extension is set to **Testnet** and that `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet` in your `.env.local`.

## Branch Naming Convention

Always branch off from `main`. Use the following prefixes:

| Prefix      | When to use                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New feature or enhancement                  |
| `fix/`      | Bug fix                                     |
| `docs/`     | Documentation only changes                  |
| `chore/`    | Tooling, config, dependency updates         |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring without behaviour change |
| `test/`     | Adding or updating tests                    |

**Format:** `<prefix>/<issue-number>-short-description`

```bash
# Examples
git checkout -b feat/42-patient-record-sharing
git checkout -b fix/17-wallet-disconnect-loop
git checkout -b docs/21-contributing-guide
```

---

## Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

**Format:**

```
type(scope): concise summary in present tense

Optional body — explain *what* changed and *why*, not *how*.
Wrap lines at 72 characters.

Closes #<issue-number>
```

**Types:**

| Type       | When to use                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | Introduces a new feature                        |
| `fix`      | Fixes a bug                                     |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                      |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change)        |
| `refactor` | Code change that is neither a fix nor a feature |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                      |
| `chore`    | Build process, tooling, dependency updates      |

**Examples:**

```
feat(appointments): add slot picker with real-time availability

fix(auth): prevent redirect loop when role is null

docs(contributing): add testnet setup instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Sync your fork** before starting work:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Open a PR against `main`** — never target another feature branch unless explicitly coordinated.

3. **Fill in the PR template** completely:
   - Clear title following the commit format
   - Summary of what changed and why
   - Link to the related issue using `Closes #<issue-number>`
   - Description of how you tested the change

4. **Review requirements:**
   - At least one approving review from a maintainer is required before merging.
   - All CI checks (build, lint, type-check) must pass.
   - Resolve all review comments before requesting a re-review.

5. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR. Avoid bundling unrelated fixes.

---

## Code Style

The project uses **ESLint** and **Prettier** for consistent formatting.

```bash
# Check for lint errors
npm run lint

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Auto-fix formatting
npm run format
```

### Naming Conventions

| Entity                | Convention                            | Example                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| React components      | PascalCase                            | `RecordCard.tsx`            |
| Hooks                 | camelCase, `use` prefix               | `useRoleRedirect.ts`        |
| Zustand stores        | camelCase, `use` prefix               | `useWalletStore.ts`         |
| Utility functions     | camelCase                             | `truncateAddress`           |
| Types / Interfaces    | PascalCase                            | `UserRole`, `MedicalRecord` |
| Environment variables | `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`       |

### Component Structure

Prefer small, single-responsibility components. Co-locate component-specific logic inside the component file unless it is reused elsewhere. Keep shared types in `src/types/index.ts`.

---

## Testing Expectations

- All new features and bug fixes must include relevant tests before a PR can be merged.
- Unit tests live alongside the code they test (e.g., `RecordCard.test.tsx` next to `RecordCard.tsx`).
- Run the test suite before pushing:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
- Aim for meaningful coverage of business logic, edge cases, and error states — not just happy paths.
- Do not disable or skip existing tests without a documented reason.

---

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

Open a **Bug Report** issue and include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs. actual behaviour
- Browser, OS, and Node.js version
- Relevant console errors or screenshots

### Feature Requests

Open a **Feature Request** issue and include:

- The problem you are trying to solve
- Your proposed solution or approach
- Any alternatives you considered

> Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
